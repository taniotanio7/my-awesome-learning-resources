**But Why?**

I starred a lot of repos on GitHub and bookmarked / pinboarded / Instapapered a lot of great resources on the Internet.
Unfortunatley I've never had time to read them all. Maybe when I categorize them in a nice and easy-to-read list I'll finally read them? 😅

**Notes from the author**

I've tried to list mainly free and open source resources like blogs, Medium articles, GitHub repos and avoid Bootcamps and paid online courses (although I don't discourage you from taking one!)

I might remove some resources that I personally find not worthy of mine and your time or aren't compliant with the rules I described.
